    <p>
      I'm a software developer and if you're a software developer too, you probably understand what it means when I say I have
      a long, and ever-growing list of things to learn. These are concepts, language, and frameworks that I need to learn
      to do my job, to be able to get another job when that day comes, and things that I am simply interested in. For years,
      I have kept this list in different places. It has existed as various pieces of paper that I eventually lost, in various
      notetaking applications, a wiki, and even Trello. Regardless of form, it has always been difficult to organize and
      prioritize.
    </p>
    <p>
      In true form, I have delayed studying the higher priority items on my list and decided to make this visualization of the
      list, the plan, the map (technically treemap) of my learning process. It is backed by a simple json object, and it's
      probably hard to get a lot of meaning from it at the moment, because the data is arbitrary, but I'll fill in hours
      and try to actually use this as a study list and prioritization tool.
