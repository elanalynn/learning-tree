# Learning Tree

This is a tool to help me visualize my learning plan and break the bigger areas up into manageable tasks.

Soon, you will be able to view the tree structure by total hours, remaining hours, or sub tasks on the categories. You will also be able to filter out completed tasks, as well as hover over the cells to get more info.

Eventually, the data should probably live in a database...

I built this using [Mike Bostock's TreeMap](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063582) as a starting point.

## Development 

- `git clone` the repo and cd into it
- run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to start development server
- run `yarn scss:watch` in a separate terminal session to watch the scss and build css
- no hot reloading yet...
